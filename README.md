# SubliminalsTV's Curated Joystick Bindings

This is the start of making my bindings open source so I can leverage the power of the Star Citizen Community to be able to release bindings faster and for more joysticks and joystick combinations.

## Who this repository is for?

- Users who have a pretty good understanding of how Joystick Gremlin works
- Users who have a decent understanding of Star Citizen's combersom binding profiles.
- Anyone in the Star Citizen community regardless of expertise who would like to test and give feedback on the most recent binds.

## Who this repository IS NOT for

- Users who want to load the most stable Joystick Gremlin, and Star Citizen binding profiles. And forgo the initial release issues.

If you are the latter please head over to the [bindings](https://subliminal.gg/bindings/) section of my website for the latest stable releases.

## How to Contribute

- Upon the release of a new patch, contributors would clear JG and SC binds
- Load the fresh clean JG profile and SC binds from the previous patch
- Consult with me via discord on what changes need to be made, if any
- Commit changes to the SC Binding XML file, and possibly the JG profile here on GitHub
- Once submitted I will verify, test, and tweak the binds, modify the binding chart, and upload it to my website for for an official release.

For more information about contributing please head to the channel discord.
